        Involves non trivial mathematics
        The tiles have, in effect, two edges. One leading down to the right,
        and one leading up to the right. These define a (non-orthogonal) basis
        (look it up) for describing the screen.
        The first vector V1 is (60,-30), the second V2= (60,30), and the
        coordinates were given XY=(x,y)
        so we want to find two numbers a and b such that:
        aV1+bV2 = XY
        Where a represents the column and b represents the row
        or, in other words:
        a(60,-30)+b(60,30) = (x,y)
        60a +60b = x
        -30a +30b = y
        so
        b = (y+30a)/30.0
        and
        60a+60*(y+30a)/30 = x
        => 60a +2y+60a = x
        => 120a = x-2y
        a = (x-2y)/120

        HOWEVER, this is calculated by reference to the a1 corner of the board
        AND assumes that y increases going upwards not downwards.

        This corner is located at 8* ISOMETRIC_TILE_HEIGHT/2  from the bottom of the canvas
        (count them)
        so first translate the x,y coordinates we have received
